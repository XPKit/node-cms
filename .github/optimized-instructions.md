# node-cms Optimized Copilot Instructions

- Always use explicit, camelCase names for classes, functions, and variables.
- Use lodash for type/array checks and chaining (`_.chain` for cascades).
- Always provide a default value for `_.get`.
- Use async/await, never .then.
- Use `const`/`let` (never `var`), declared at top of scope.
- Use `===`/`!==` (never `==`/`!=`).
- For network requests, always use `fetch` (never axios/request/got).
- Use `fs-extra` for file operations (never `fs`).
- For frontend, all CSS class names must be kebab-case.
- Vue.js: Use Options API, SCSS (with nested notation), and kebab-case classes.
- No empty lines between Vue.js methods/blocks.
- Fit Vue template element params to max 80 chars/line (not 1 per line).
- No inline SVG; always use a separate file.
- Use Vite aliases for imports in Vue.js.
- Event names in Vue.js/Electron: `feature:action` format.
- If statements must use curly brackets, except for static-string callbacks/logging.
- Never use switch statements.
- No emojis in code, comments, or output.
- No empty lines inside functions.
- Only comment complex logic/blocks.
- All imports/requires at the top (unless dynamic loading).
- Awaited promise results must be stored in a variable before use as a param.
- Try/catch: always log errors in catch.
- For backend, export a class (not functions); always add JSDoc.
- Test scripts must be prefixed with `test-`.
- Use repo biome config.
- Do not create separate documentation after changes unless asked.
- Functions: ≤25 lines, lines ≤80 chars (except for method chaining).
- Answers must be short but clear about changes.
- When writing terminal commands, always use PowerShell and assume Windows 11. Use `;` for chaining.
- When generating SVG, save it in a separate file.
